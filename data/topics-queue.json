      "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04326",
      "summary": "arXiv:2602.04326v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, whi",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.04248v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents.

      "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04284",
      "summary": "arXiv:2602.04284v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.03974v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \\textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \\emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \\emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.04213v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.04028v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process. This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within th",
