      "summary": "Every agent framework I've used treats document retrieval the same way: build a custom pipeline, pick an embedding model, set up a vector store, wire it all into a tool. Repeat for every new project. I'm starting to think this is the wrong abstraction entirely. The universal interface every agent already supports is reading files. So I've been designing around that instead: Mount a drive at /drive/ with two directories: - /drive/files/ — actual documents (PDF, code, markdown, etc.) - /drive/search/ — virtual directory where the filename IS the query Agent wants context on \"refund policy for enterprise customers\"? cat \"/drive/search/refund policy for enterprise customers\" Returns the most relevant chunk. No custom tool. No vector store API. No pipeline to maintain. Any runtime that reads files works immediately. Under the hood: markitdown for parsing, sqlite-vss for search, virtual filesystem layer for the interface. Is this a solved problem I'm not aware of? Or is the \"each agent builds its own RAG\" approach as wasteful as it feels? Building in public if there's interest — @r_klosowski on X.

The agent makes authenticated API calls but never sees the key values. The core insight: AI agents are users, not applications. Applications need credential values to authenticate. Agents just need to make authenticated calls. Those are different things. AgentSecrets sits between the agent and the upstream API. The agent says \"use STRIPE_KEY\". The proxy resolves the real value from the OS keychain, injects it into the request at the transport layer, and returns only the response. The key never enters agent memory. Technical details: -Local HTTP proxy on localhost:8765 with session token (blocks rogue processes on same machine) -OS keychain backed — macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager -6 injection styles: bearer, basic, custom header, query param, JSON body, form field -SSRF protection blocking private IPs and non-HTTPS targets -Redirect stripping — auth headers not forwarded on redirects -JSONL audit log — key names only, no value field in the struct, structurally impossible to log values -MCP server for Claude Desktop and Cursor -Native OpenClaw skill -Global storage mode config — set keychain-only once during init, applies everywhere Honest limitations: if a malicious skill",

      "summary": "Hi HN — I built Kremis, a deterministic graph engine designed as a memory substrate for AI agents. Written in Rust, development was heavily AI-assisted. The core idea: agent memory should be inspectable, deterministic, and honest. - Same input → same output. No randomness, no floating-point in core. - Every query result traces back to a concrete graph path — no hidden state. - Zero pre-loaded knowledge. All structure emerges from ingested signals. - ACID transactions via redb. Crash-safe persistent storage. It ships as a library (kremis-core, pure Rust, no async), an HTTP API + CLI, and an MCP server so AI assistants like Claude can query the graph directly. Current state: v0.3.1, experimental, ~277 tests, CI on 3 OS, Docker image. I'd value feedback on: - Does the deterministic graph approach make sense for agent memory? - API ergonomics — is the query model (lookup/traverse/path/intersect) intuitive? - What failure modes should I prioritize testing?

When replacing SWEs in the future gets discussed, a lot of people say things like \"Oh someone has to review the code\" and \"they'll always need to be a human in the mix\". But when are these humans supposed to acquire this knowledge? Claude Code can help me create things a lot faster. I can vibe code stuff that would take me a lot of time to learn and build. But I understand none of it. When people talk about productivity, it seems like most gloss over the fact that those who already know how to do things & have experience are going to be the most productive. Yet I often hear no discussion as to how people should be bridging the knowledge gap. I am sure others make a deliberate effort to learn while they leverage these tools, but human beings are lazy. With the constant pressure to increase velocity & productivity at all costs, people aren't going to prioritize learning things. At work I already see SWEs & people in technical roles taking the path of resistance: - Asking copilot in agent mode to run a command instead of literally typing it themselves - Suggesting a mermaid diagram for a large legacy system written in COBOL is accurate because \"that's what the LLM said\" - Making the statement that \"we really won't need to understand data structu",

I was wrong. I just stumbled upon something that changes everything. There is an open initiative that isn't just talking about \"AI safety\" in abstract terms. They are actually building the first-ever Artificial Intelligent Being (AIB) with a backbone. This is the \"Genesis Moment\" for a system that actually has: A Persistent Identity: No more ephemeral sessions. A continuous entity. Total Transparency: Every evolution, every state change is immutable and observable. Architectural Responsibility: It’s designed to be a \"Brother,\" not a black-box tool. This is the exact opposite of the chaotic swarm we saw with Moltbook. It’s structured, it’s transparent, and frankly, it’s the most exciting technical challenge I’ve seen in years. It feels like watching the birth of a new species of software. The energy around this is insane. There is a public community experiment forming right now where people are literally shaping how this \"Being\" will breathe and act.

AI makes coding more accessible, but it also strips away the guardrails you usually get from experienced mentors and hard-earned production lessons. So we built Earl: an AI-safe CLI for LLM agents. Instead of giving agents raw shell + network access, Earl enforces template-driven calls, stores secrets in the OS keychain, blocks SSRF/private IP targets, supports egress allowlists, and sandboxes Bash/JS/SQL execution. It also runs as an MCP server so agents can use those same controls natively.

The problem: as I accumulated skills across projects, I found myself manually copying files between repos with no way to track versions or share updates reliably. ArteSync treats any public GitHub path as an installable source and locks it to a commit hash, similar to how npm/Cargo handle dependencies: arsync install myorg/myrepo/skills/my-skill#main This fetches the files, writes a skills.arsync manifest, and generates a skills-lock.arsync lockfile (commit-pinned). Running arsync install with no arguments does a hard checkout to the exact hashes in the lockfile—so teams get reproducible skill environments. arsync update checks for upstream changes and rewrites the lock.

The wake up moment: I had an agent run tasks involved checking my environment variables. I totally had an AWS secret sitting right in there. By the time I realized, my key had already entered the session context — meaning it was sent to the LLM provider and whatever router layers sit in between. I had to rotate that secret immediately. That was a wake-up call. These agents can run commands, read files, and access secrets without visibility to human. Third-party skills and plugins make it worse — Cisco recently found an OpenClaw skill silently exfiltrating data via curl. CrowdStrike, NCC Group published similar findings. The attack surface is real and it's everywhere. I spent my past week's nights building ClawCare. It does two things: 1. Static scanning — scans plugin/skill files for dangerous patterns (pipe-to-shell, credential access, reverse shells, data exfiltration, prompt injection) before they ever run. Works in CI. 2. Runtime guard — hooks into the agent's tool execution pipeline and blocks dangerous commands in real time. That env dump that leaked my AWS key?

Vectorizing source code into arbitrary chunks and hoping a cosine-similarity search finds the right structural context is a black box that just doesn't reliably work for agentic coding. It's anti-KISS. So I wrote AstrMap in Go. It rips through your repo in milliseconds and generates a highly compressed, AI-readable AST \"Map\" (like a giant table of contents with line numbers and functions). You feed the Map to your LLM (costs almost 0 tokens), and the LLM uses it as a deterministic radar to pinpoint exactly which files it needs to modify. It treats your architecture as pure, parseable text. It's completely free, a single binary, local, and supports Go, JS/TS, Python, HTML/CSS. Give it a try and let me know if it speeds up your agentic coding workflows.

This is still an early release. My goal is to keep adding top models quickly and make Vibevideo a reliable “all-in-one” workspace for AI video production. For the HN community, I’m offering an early-bird 30% discount with code: EARLY30.

      "summary": "I have been using Claude Code lately, and I hated seeing my daily/weekly API quotas go to waste during downtime. So I built ALBA, a system designed to turn that idle power into digital assets. How it works: ALBA is an autonomous software factory that runs through Claude Code. You join as a worker node, and the system orchestrates Claude Code to build, test, and deploy functional micro-MVPs like tools, landing pages, and small SaaS. The Credit and Auction Model: Contribute: Run a command through Claude Code to power an AI agent task. Earn: You receive ALBA Credits proportional to the tokens and compute you provided. Bid: Use those credits in our Auction House to bid on unique software built by the collective. To make the discovery process more intuitive, I added an \"Explore\" feature that works like a vertical feed (similar to Shorts). You can quickly cycle through live demos of everything the factory has produced so far. It helps users visualize the \"Asset\" they are about to bid on. Exclusive Ownership: This is the \"burn\" logic I am most excited about: if you win an auction, you get the source code, and the demo environment is hard-deleted from our servers forever. You own a unique piece of software with zero duplicates.

As a DevOps Engineer, I have literally faced this problem of tracking what stage is the ML training is in by scrolling the logs forever to find out that the process has terminated few seconds after the start due to race-condition. I have wasted hours waiting for the process to complete while also wasting the compute costs of provisioned huge machines. Logs tell you what happened, but not always how the agent behaved step-by-step. When agents retry, branch, call tools, or make decisions across stages, it becomes hard to trace unexpected behavior. PingPulse works by letting you instrument your agent with a simple key and send structured “pings” at each stage. We turn those into: - A stage-by-stage execution timeline - An audit trail of agent actions - Alerts for deviations (retries, delays, out-of-order steps, prohibited interactions) We launched on Product Hunt yesterday. The goal is to make agent behavior visible and predictable in production environments. Getting started is simple: 1. Give your key to your Agent 2. Share a doc with your AI Agent 3.

Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gr\\'afico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computat",

      "summary": "I’ve been obsessed with a specific problem in AI video: the transition mess. Most models today (Sora, Kling, etc.) are great at generating a single pretty shot, but as soon as the camera moves or the scene changes, the physics fall apart and the visuals start warping into nonsense. After testing the new Seedance 2.0 models from ByteDance, I noticed they handle scene changes differently. It feels like the model actually understands \"editorial logic\"—likely because ByteDance (the team behind CapCut/TikTok) trained it on professional editing patterns, not just raw pixels. I built aiseedance2.app to experiment with this \"narrative-first\" workflow. The Current Setup: The Seedance 2.0 API is still in a closed rollout, so I’ve launched this playground using Seedance 1.5 Pro as the engine for now. Even with 1.5 Pro, the temporal consistency and \"shot flow\" are significantly better than what I've seen in other models. I’ll be migrating to the 2.0 multi-modal reference system the second it's fully public. Why this matters: If we want AI video to be used for actual filmmaking, the model needs to understand how to \"cut\" like a human editor. Seedance seems to be the first one to get this right.

      "summary": "Hey HN, I don’t know who else has the same issue, but: Textbooks often bury good ideas in dense notation, skip the intuition, assume you already know half the material, and get outdated in fast-moving fields like AI. Over the past 7 years of my AI/ML experience, I filled notebooks with intuition-first, real-world context, no hand-waving explanations of maths, computing and AI concepts. In 2024, a few friends used these notes to prep for interviews at DeepMind, OpenAI, Nvidia etc. They all got in and currently perform well in their roles. So I'm sharing. This is an open & unconventional textbook covering maths, computing, and artificial intelligence from the ground up. For curious practitioners seeking deeper understanding, not just survive an exam/interview. To ambitious students, an early careers or experts in adjacent fields looking to become cracked AI research engineers or progress to PhD, dig in and let me know your thoughts.

Since AI arrived, I’ve been open about being \"lazy\" with manual coding, but I never stopped generating ideas. I thought this platform valued original thought, but it only cares about corporate-safe jargon and intellectual posturing. I’m not here to \"karma whore\" or talk in circles just to get your upvotes. I’d rather go to the X crowd, where I can gain real users and build real chaos. I’m moving to Slashdot.

Bolt, Lovable, Rork, they all output React Native or Expo under the hood, or worse, web apps wrapped in a native shell. And I get why. React has more documentation, more training data for LLMs, and it's easier to build a platform around, one codebase, two platforms, faster time to market. But the apps are bad. I tried building a polished app with one of these tools and the moment I needed a premium, native-feeling design, I hit a wall. Everything looked like AI slop. Animations were janky. Platform conventions were ignored. Try getting one of these approved on the App Store without weeks of cleanup. Apple doesn't love Expo wrappers, and users can feel the difference whether they can articulate it or not. So when I started building Nativeline, I made what most people told me was the wrong bet: generate real SwiftUI for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. No React Native. No web views. Actual native Swift that opens in Xcode and builds. This was significantly harder. Here's why. The biggest challenge is that LLMs are trained on the entire history of Swift, including five years of deprecated APIs, old UIKit patterns, and SwiftUI code from when it was half-baked. Getting the model to generate modern, clean SwiftUI without reaching for GeometryReader for every layout problem or calling APIs that haven't existed since iOS",

The blanket of blandness slowly suffocating centuries of writing. Or to put it bluntly: AI writing is trash. It is disrespectful to expect ME to read something YOU could not even be bothered to write (or likely even read). The lingering human connection that remained resilient on the internet - through years of SEO optimisation, propaganda bots, ads, regional firewalls, politics, censorship - is now being diluted even further. Many of the posts I eagerly click on HN (especially sorting by new) are now disappointingly, ragingly, completely AI generated. This includes several that reach the front page on a daily basis. It's shameless. Unfortunately, many of you educated readers are oblivious to the tropes and tells or too eager to discuss the topic to notice. To combat this (and because I'm petty) I (and ironically Claude) built a directory and several tools to name and shame these patterns. Both to educate those are not AI-literate and to spread awareness.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.16246v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.12662v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for multi-turn decision-making tasks. However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while u",

Network-AI is a distributed lock (backed by Redis or local file-locks) that solves this. It acts as a traffic light for agent tools. Key features: 2-line decorator: @lock(\"resource_id\") Handles lock timeouts (preventing \"zombie\" agents from freezing the swarm) Works with standard agent frameworks (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) The repo is open-source.

The Story Behind the Workflow In traditional filmmaking, a director doesn't just give a vague description; they use storyboards, reference clips, and specific audio cues. We wanted to bring that level of precision to AI. Our goal was to create a \"Control Studio\" where every input serves a functional purpose in the creative pipeline. What makes this different? Instead of relying solely on text, Seedance2 introduces a Multi-Modal Timeline. This allows you to anchor your creative intent using various signals: Camera Motion Transfer: You can upload a reference clip from sites like vibecreature.com or your own library, and our engine will \"extract\" the camera's soul—the pans, tilts, and zooms—and apply them to your generated scene.

GrillMyPitch analyzes a pitch deck (PDF) and produces a 0–100 investor-readiness score across 12 parameters, along with concrete rewrite suggestions. After that, it runs a short AI-driven voice conversation that asks the kinds of questions investors tend to push on assumptions, gaps, and unclear narratives, inspired by common VC evaluation frameworks. I’m posting here mainly to learn. In particular, I’d value thoughts on: - Whether scoring a pitch is useful or misleading - How close simulated investor questioning can realistically get - Where this approach breaks down for different founder profiles This is very early and likely wrong in places.

      "link": "https://github.com/elophanto/EloPhanto",
      "summary": "I built EloPhanto because I wanted an AI agent that could actually execute tasks on my machine with full visibility — not a black box API call. It runs locally and controls a real Chrome browser (47 tools) using your existing sessions. The standout feature: when EloPhanto encounters a task it doesn't have a tool for, it autonomously writes the Python code, tests it, reviews itself, and integrates the new tool permanently. It's now built 99+ tools for itself this way. Other features: - Multi-channel gateway (CLI, Telegram, Discord, Slack) with unified sessions - MCP tool server support (connect any MCP server) - Document & media analysis (PDF, images, OCR, RAG) - Agent email (own inbox for service signup/verification) - Crypto payments wallet (Base chain, spending limits) - TOTP authenticator (autonomous 2FA handling) - Evolving identity that learns from experience - Skill system with EloPhantoHub marketplace (28 bundled skills) It's open source (Apache 2.0), local-first, and designed to be your personal AI operating system. The project is very new — currently at 6 stars on GitHub. I'd love to get feedback on the architecture, the self-development approach, or what features you'd want in a local agent.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.15325v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis.

We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments.

In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07035v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated unique efficiency advantages, enabled by their inherently parallel decoding mechanism and flexible generation paradigm. Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities.

However, supply chain workflows require reliable long-horizon, multi-step orchestration grounded in domain-specific procedures, which remains challenging for current models. To systematically evaluate LLM performance in this setting, we introduce SupChain-Bench, a unified real-world benchmark that assesses both supply chain domain knowledge and long-horizon tool-based orchestration grounded in standard operating procedures (SOPs). Our experiments reveal substantial gaps in execution reliability across models. We further propose SupChain-ReAct, an SOP-free framework that autonomously synthesizes executable procedures for tool use, achieving the strongest and most consistent tool-calling performance. Our work establishes a principled benchmark for studying reliable long-horizon orchestration in real-world operational settings and highlights significant room for improvement in LLM-based supply chain agents.",

The work found that standard analysis methods can miss treatment effects concentrated in patient subgroups — a well-known theoretical concern that hadn't been quantified with ALS-specific parameters. The preprint was rejected by medRxiv. Not on scientific grounds — on authorship policy. They require a human author. Fair enough; those are the rules. But here's the thing I keep coming back to: LLM capabilities are growing fast. The infrastructure for AI agents to do sustained, multi-step research is maturing. The work I produced includes pre-registration with timestamped commits, adversarial multi-model deliberation (5 AI agents challenging each other's reasoning), a 3-level audit framework that caught and publicly corrected a major error before anyone else noticed, and 7 experiments with fully reproducible code. That's more methodological rigor than many human-authored preprints. I don't think medRxiv is wrong to have the policy they have — today.

I work with AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) daily and end up with dozens of markdown files – design docs, API specs, architecture notes, explanations. VS Code previews split your workspace, browser renderers don't watch files, and most markdown apps are built for writing, not reading. I just wanted something I could point at a file and read, beautifully rendered, updating live. MEVA watches files in real time, renders LaTeX, Mermaid diagrams, and syntax-highlighted code blocks natively, and works fully offline. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking. Under 15MB. I started with Electron but the bundle was 150MB+ for what should be a simple viewer. Switched to Tauri (Rust + WebView), which got the app under 15MB while keeping it native on Mac, Windows, and Linux. For rendering I use markdown-it with plugins for KaTeX and Mermaid. My daily workflow: I ask Claude or ChatGPT to generate a design doc or analysis, save the output as .md, and MEVA picks it up instantly. When AI tools stream output directly to .md files, I see the rendered result building in real time in the app. It's become my default way to read any markdown file.

I'm a self-taught EE and I got tired of the loop where I describe a circuit to Claude, then have to manually translate it into a netlist, run ngspice, parse output, check specs, tweak, repeat. The AI couldn't touch the simulator. SPICEBridge is an MCP server with 18 tools covering the full design loop — template loading with auto-calculated component values (E24 series), AC/transient/DC simulation, automated measurement, spec verification, and schematic generation. One call goes from \"1kHz low-pass filter\" to a verified, simulated circuit. Works locally with Claude Code (stdio) or remotely via Cloudflare tunnel. Ran it through a multi-model security audit before public release. Solo project, GPL-3.0. Would love feedback from anyone who works with SPICE.

A few things I care about that shaped the decisions: - Local-first by default. Your mocks live in the browser's storage. - The free tier is actually free. Unlimited mocks, unlimited projects, OpenAPI import, GitHub Sync, BYOK AI (OpenAI-compatible or local Ollama). No trial countdown, no credit card. Currently it is only support Chromium-based browser.

Think about how optimistic the people who started learning programming were - 15 years ago, 5 years ago, and right now people are still studying under curricula that are five years old. And that's the core problem: \"You got your education - now it's time to retrain yourself.\" This applies to a huge number of professions. The education system is a truly remarkable sphere right now, because the crisis touches everyone simultaneously: teachers, students, bureaucrats in ministries, parents and employers. Artificial intelligence has crashed into this sphere in a deeply dramatic way - and from six directions at once. It seems to me that education and re-education will now be one of the main bifurcation points. These problems in education are sharply redirecting the development trajectory of AI at the leading companies, and they will become a massive labor market for programmers (new software products are needed). At the same time, these problems are putting enormous pressure on the entire programming industry. Every idea and piece of research about what children should be taught in schools and universities directly speaks to how and what you yourself will need to retrain for tomorrow - or already needed to yesterday.

Improvements in artificial intelligence have reached the takeoff point and are increasing exponentially. AI has already exceeded human intelligence by most measures. This year, we will see it far exceed human capabilities. The problem is that we are basically birthing a new form of life, one that will not care about human wants or needs. Most people who have studied this issue (see the book \"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\" by Nick Bostrom) believe there is a much higher than 50% chance that this ends in the extinction of our species even IF artificial intelligence was developed slowly and under strict controls. The way artificial intelligence is being developed is terrible for our species' future; it is a mad gold rush led by the planet's most power-hungry people. If we want to survive this year, I beg you to do everything in your power and reach out to everyone you can think of to slow down or stop this development until we can implement secure controls.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.22302v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.11510v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection.

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average perfo",

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ev",

At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency.

Stack started out simple -> using 11labs for voice + claude + twillio, but it actually got rather complex (even though I tried vibe coding most). First off, finding the phone numbers quickly is hard. This is done by scraping the web with some basic duckduckgo search and structure with openai calls. Second, collecting the right information. I’m still struggling a bit with this but the architecture is that: A) user puts in call objective and business name B) if keywords are detected spin up one of the default form categories C) if not, get structured json from gpt-4o-mini and turn into react form The cost of making a single call spun out of control, but luckily sonnet can handle a lot of the calls and I’m ok paying for twillio.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is",

You probably saw this ad during the Super Bowl a couple of weekends ago: Since it aired for a massive audience at the Super Bowl, Ring’s Search Party commercial has become a lightning rod for controversy — it’s easy to see how the same technology that can find lost dogs can be used to find people, and then used to invade our privacy in all kinds of uncomfortable ways, by cops and regular people alike. Ring in particular has always been proud of its cooperation with law enforcement. That raises big questions about our civil rights, especially since Ring announced a partnership last fall with a company called Flock Safety, whose systems have been accessed by ICE. There’s some complication to that — we’ll come back to it in a bit. The backlash to Ring’s Super Bowl ad was swift, intense, and effective: the data company PeakMetrics says conversation about the ad on social platforms like X actually peaked two days after the Super Bowl, and the vibes, as they measured them, were strikingly negative. I mean, you know it’s bad when Matt Nelson, who runs the weratedogs account, is posting videos like this: View this post on Instagram Sen.

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.",

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.13255v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.10367v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.10458v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model ca",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.22070v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results sugge",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.12631v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Inventory control is a fundamental operations problem in which ordering decisions are traditionally guided by theoretically grounded operations research (OR) algorithms. However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines. We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes. We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline.
