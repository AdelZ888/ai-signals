## Builder TL;DR

One-sentence summary: use a world model (Genie 3) to generate photorealistic, interactive driving scenes and feed them into your perception + planner test harness to exercise rare edge cases (for example: tornadoes or large animals) — The Verge reports Waymo is doing this with Google DeepMind’s Genie 3: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Why it matters: synthetic scenario generation scales edge-case coverage beyond replay-only tests and accelerates discovery of safety-critical failures; the Verge piece documents the industry pattern of using a world-building model to create diverse simulated edge cases: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Quick implementation checklist (artifact): prompt → scene export → sensor config → scenario JSON → rollout script. See Assumptions / Hypotheses for engineering defaults.

Methodology note: this brief uses The Verge report as the grounding datapoint that Waymo has employed a world-model (Genie 3) to produce interactive simulated edge cases: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

## Goal and expected outcome

Primary goal: produce reproducible, labeled edge-case scenarios (for example: tornadoes, large animals, debris fields) generated by a world model and run them through your AV perception → prediction → planning stack to measure impacts on safety metrics (as an industry pattern described in The Verge): https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Expected outcomes:
- A scenario library indexed by seed and scenario ID for deterministic replay.
- Reproducible repro cases for debugging and minimal reproducers for root-cause analysis.
- Pass/fail signals that can gate model promotions and CI deployments (see Assumptions / Hypotheses for example gates).

Metrics table (example structure; numeric gates are in Assumptions / Hypotheses):

| Metric | What it measures | Gate / Threshold (see Assumptions) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Perception false negative rate | Missed object detections in a defined critical zone | see Assumptions / Hypotheses |
| Time-to-brake latency | Delay from detection to braking command | see Assumptions / Hypotheses |
| Detection range (object) | Distance at which an object is reliably detected | see Assumptions / Hypotheses |
| Reproducibility | Same seed, same config replays | see Assumptions / Hypotheses |

Acceptance criteria: a scenario is validated when it reproduces across seeded runs and meets gating thresholds defined in Assumptions / Hypotheses. Adjust gates to your operational risk tolerance and regulatory needs. Reference: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

## Stack and prerequisites

Core components you need (high-level):

- Access to a world-model generator able to emit photorealistic, interactive scenes (Genie 3 or equivalent) — documented industry usage: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.
- Scene exporter/adapter to transform model output into your simulator asset format (FBX/GLTF or custom bundle).
- Sensor renderer and physics engine to synthesize camera, LiDAR, and radar logs.
- AV stack under test (perception → prediction → planning) with a test harness and metric logging.
- Orchestration + queueing system to run parallel rollouts and store telemetry.

Team prerequisites: prompt engineer(s) for scenario prompts, simulation engineers for asset conversion, safety engineers for metrics and gates, and ops for compute and quota monitoring. See Assumptions / Hypotheses for example compute and sensor defaults: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

## Step-by-step implementation

1. Design edge-case spec.
   - Define a compact spec: event type (tornado / large-animal), location relative to ego, timing, actor behaviors and constraints. Save as a decision table.
   - Use the Verge report to justify exploring these edge cases with a world model: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

2. Prompt the world model (iterative).
   - Create concise prompts: visual style (photoreal), scene layout, object specs, and interaction cues (for example: a large animal crossing 300 m ahead). Iterate until assets contain required actors and effects.

3. Export and instrument.
   - Convert world-model output to your sim asset format. Attach sensor configs and deterministic seeds. Produce a scenario JSON with seeds, actor scripts and variability parameters.

4. Run rollouts (scale & randomize).
   - Start with a smaller sweep for feedback, then scale to larger batches once configs are stable. Ensure orchestration preserves reproducible seeds and stable cluster utilization.

5. Evaluate and triage.
   - Run automated metric extraction on logs and compare to gates. Aggregate failures into a repro queue and produce minimal reproducers for debugging.

Rollout / rollback plan (example stages): synthetic-only internal verification → closed-course correlation → gated CI promotions; automatic rollback if a safety metric regresses beyond a preset delta. See Assumptions / Hypotheses for example deltas and canary levels.

- [ ] Create scenario repo and seed list
- [ ] Implement deterministic seeding and export adapter
- [ ] Add gated CI tests for scenario runs

## Reference architecture

High-level flow (conceptual):

Genie 3 world-model (prompt) → scene asset exporter → sensor renderer & physics → AV stack (perception → prediction → planning) → telemetry & metrics pipeline. The Verge describes this approach being used for edge-case generation and interactive scenes: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Integration points to implement:
- Scene-to-sim adapter with deterministic seed mapping and a schema for scenario JSON.
- Metrics aggregator with pass/fail gating and reproducibility checks.
- Orchestration queue with canary and batch worker pools; require audit trails for seeds and versions.

## Founder lens: ROI and adoption path

Short-term ROI: lower hours of live rare-event collection by surfacing edge cases faster via synthetic generation; the Verge coverage shows teams adopting world-model-driven synthetic edge-case generation: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Adoption path (practical): pilot a focused set of scenarios, validate correlation to closed-course tests over a defined period (for example, 30 days), then fold successful scenario generators into nightly CI runs behind feature flags.

Decision factors:
- Correlation rate between synthetic failures and closed-course failures.
- Cost per meaningful repro discovered (compute + engineering time).
- Regulatory evidence mix required (percentage of field-based vs synthetic evidence).

## Failure modes and debugging

The Verge article frames world-model-driven sims as a tool to generate diverse simulated edge cases, and it implies both opportunity and potential issues such as hallucination and sim-to-real mismatch: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Primary failure modes to monitor:
- Sim-to-real gap: visuals may be photoreal but physics or sensor-noise differences create mismatches; require closed-course correlation before trusting promotions.
- World-model hallucination: visually plausible but physically inconsistent objects or behaviors appear in generated scenes.
- Overfitting to simulator artifacts: models learn simulator-specific patterns that don't hold in the real world.

Debugging artifacts to maintain:
- Deterministic seeds and scenario IDs for every failing rollout.
- Replay logs (video + raw sensor frames) and minimal reproducers that reduce the scenario to the smallest failing variant.
- A standardized hallucination and physical-consistency checklist for manual reviews.

Suggested alarm triggers and triage thresholds are listed in Assumptions / Hypotheses. Reference: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

## Production checklist

### Assumptions / Hypotheses

Grounding: The Verge confirms the pattern that Waymo has used Genie 3 for photorealistic world-model simulation and that world-model-driven edge-case generation is an active practice in the field: https://www.theverge.com/transportation/874771/waymo-world-model-simulation-google-deepmind-genie-3.

Engineering defaults and example thresholds (to validate against closed-course and field data):

- Perception false negative gate: 1% (example).
- Time-to-brake latency gate: 150 ms.
- Camera frame rate: 30 fps.
- LiDAR points/s: 2,000,000 points/s.
- Detection reliable range: 60 m.
- Initial batch run count: 1,000 rollouts.
- Reproducibility target: 90% same-seed replay agreement.
- Canary promotion steps: 3 stages; example canary traffic levels: 10% → 50% → 100%.
- Pilot budget cap (example): $20,000/month.

Metrics & gates (concrete examples):

| Metric | Gate / Threshold |
|---|---:|
| Perception false negative rate | < 1% |
| Time-to-brake latency | < 150 ms |
| Detection reliable range | >= 60 m |
| Reproducibility (same-seed) | >= 90% |

Example deterministic scenario JSON (use seed and minimal variability):

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "tornado_001",
  "seed": 42,
  "actors": [{"type": "tornado", "start_m": 300}],
  "randomization": {"wind_strength": [5, 20], "debris_count": 10}
}
```

Example parallel rollout command for a pilot (caps and numbers are examples in Assumptions above):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
SCENARIO=scenarios/tornado_001.json
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do
  seed=$((RANDOM%10000))
  ./run_sim --scenario ${SCENARIO} --seed ${seed} --out logs/run_${seed}.tar &
  if (( $(jobs -r | wc -l) > 50 )); then
    wait -n
  fi
done
wait
```

Deterministic artifact requirements:
- Every scenario must record generator model version, prompt text, seed, and asset export hash.
- Every rollout must produce a compact repro package (scenario JSON + seed + minimal frame window) for triage.

### Risks / Mitigations

- Risk: world model produces nonphysical scenes.
  - Mitigation: automated physical-consistency validator + manual spot checks on a sample (e.g., 5% of generated scenarios).
- Risk: cost overruns from rendering and API usage.
  - Mitigation: autoscaling, budget alerts, and an initial pilot cap (example cap $20,000/month).
- Risk: over-reliance on synthetic data.
  - Mitigation: require closed-course correlation and mandate that at least a configurable minimum fraction of gating evidence be field-based (example: ≥ 30% real-world evidence).

### Next steps

- Implement the scene-to-sim adapter, deterministic seeding, and metadata capture for prompts and model versions.
- Run a 1,000-rollout pilot, extract metrics, and compute sim-vs-field deltas over 30 days.
- If deltas are within acceptable ranges, integrate scenario generation into nightly CI and use feature flags for planner promotions.
